* Hacker News Clone - CLI Version

The MVP of this project is a clone of https://news.ycombinator.com but in CLI. 

A user should be able to: 
- read a list of articles in the database from the command line
- create a new story by posting a link and a title
- vote up or down on a story 

** voting 
*** registration 
required to comment (?) 
*** search
by popularity, date. I find it effective. 
*** threaded collapsible comments
- All threads threaded and collapsible. maxed by default. each can be minimized individually, collapsing all contained comments. 
- main threads sorted by quality, replies chronological (?), 
- poor quality comments remain visible but dimmed according to how downvoted  
*** user karma
- users have karma
- user post/comment history can be seen by clicking on their profile. 
*** voting 
regiistration required
min karma required for downvoting (comments only?) 
*** sort algorithms (see note below) 
- posts sorted by ratio of upvotes / newness / user karma / voodoo 
*** user control of search / sort options 
- users can view HN sorted view, chrono posts, chrono comments, (?) 
*** 'dead' (shadowbanned) profiles 
These are profiles where the user doesn't know they are 'shadowbanned', so they continue to post but can't tell that no one else can see it.

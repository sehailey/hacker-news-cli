<h1 id="hacker-news-clone---cli-version">Hacker News Clone - CLI Version</h1>
<p>The MVP of this project is a clone of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" class="uri">https://news.ycombinator.com</a> but in CLI. A user should be able to log in from the command line and be presented with a list of stories, along with a 'menu bar' that has the options in HN: news, comments, ask, show, jobs, submit (we will likely not use all of these options, but let's keep it as a clone for now).</p>
